# Furniture Store Project

This project is a furniture store website that showcases various furniture items under different categories. Users can browse different categories and view details of each item.

## Approach

We have developed this project using a full-stack approach. The backend is implemented using Node.js and Express for creating the server and handling API requests. The frontend is built with React for a dynamic and responsive user interface.

  - React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - React Router: Declarative routing for React.js.
  - Bootstrap: Front-end framework for responsive design.

- **Backend:**
  - Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment.
  - Express: Web application framework for Node.js.


#Install dependencies for both backend and frontend:

-cd backend
-npm install

-node api.js

#Run the Frontend server (from the backend directory):
